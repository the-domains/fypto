The market is topping out, be prepared.  Global economics are working against the stock and equity markets right now.  Bearish technicals are developing on the S&P500\.

China is currently devaluing it's currency, and quickly.  As the equity markets in China have cooled down, the PBOC decided it was time to allow CNY to devalue for the first time in years.  Devaluation is bad for the people in china, as they begin to lose buying power and at the same time their wealth in equities is declining.  To combat this, China initiated capital controls limiting the movement of money out of the country.  This is just more bad news for an economy rapidly cooling after seeing incredibly aggressive growth.  The troubles there are just beginning. On Monday the Shanghai composite hit trading halts after declines hit 7% during the trading session.

Yellen recently decided it was to raise rates in the United States.  The fed had kept interest rates negligible since the great recession.  This free money has propped up equity markets where additional capital was seeking growth.  As interest rates begin to rise, this capital will be forced to flea equity markets for safer yields.  This is bad news for investors who will begin to see more aggressive declines in the major indices.

The Fed decision also has other effects.  A rising dollar doesn't just impact our purchasing power as citizens, it also reduces purchasing power for currencies around the world.  Currencies pegged against the dollar begin to lose value as the dollar gains, and because the dollar is the worlds reserve currency the effects are dramatic.  Third world and emerging economies begin to lose purchasing power.  As their wealth begins to deterioriate, it's reflected in their corporate balance sheets and equity markets.  Consider that the last raise in interest rates occurred in late 2006, shortly before the financial meltdown.

Lastly, the technicals are just right.  The S&P500 has been completely flat over the last year, resulting in a rounded top forming on the index.  Recent declines have begun to push the index under it's SMA (Simple Moving Average) and may accelerate if it declines much further.  There has been a decline on average every 7 to 8 years for the last 25 years or so. Today we are about 8 years from the decline in 2008 and it would match the pattern well.

If we do see declines, it might make sense to have capital available to purchase the declines once they have stopped.  A decline in equity markets could also push wealth to seek other asset classes, like commodities. Throughout history these type of declines have allowed investors to increase their wealth . This may be a similar opportunity for those who are prepared for any decline.
